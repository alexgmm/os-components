Heuristic components analysis for Open Shop Scheduling Problem.

- I did this work for my thesis (which is currently being finished)
- The complete results can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LB0aV1K83khSgiIePQiiwQVM0g236GkT4kmlp4kfC7Y/edit?usp=sharing)

To generate the main results you can evoke the method `generateHeuristicMetrics()`. It should take about 19 hours to generate the complete set.
